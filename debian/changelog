elliptics (2.6.3-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for configurable content types.  Config should enable
    following option (lighttpd example): "DNET_FCGI_CONTENT_TYPES" =>

    to the second part. Only works for direct download, i.e. through
    proxy. Changed default error codes: when lookup/read returns -ENOENT
    (no object) status will be set to 404 and otherwise to 403. Added
    Cache-control: no-cache where needed. # Please enter the commit
    message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored,
    and an empty message aborts the commit. # Explicit paths specified
