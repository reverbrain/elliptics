- server_send: print queue size when sending write request

- recovery: monitor: fixed metrics: 'local_read_bytes', 'remote_written_bytes' etc
- recovery: recover keys by window not by batch - closes
- 	Previous logic - recovery gets batch of keys, recovers them in parallel,

- added top events settings to monitoring/top provider
- net stats in procfs provider: rx/tx bytes, packets, error count for net interfaces
- removed unused sha384 functions and unification with eblob cryptolib
- mmap elimination - mmap() replaced with pread(). Corrupted filesystem may return -EIO for some reads, while
- 	trying to access that data via mmap ends up with SIGBUS signal, which kills whole eblob user.

- 	Recovery with this option will not check metadata, will not replace old records by new ones and
- 	will only copy some available replica of keys to groups which do not have these keys.
- pytests: added case to test_session_iterator that check iterating with no_meta flag
- recovery: added 'recovery_speed' and 'iteration_speed' to statistics. Both values are mesuared in records per second.

- recovery: replaced cPickle by msgpack for packing intermediate results
- recovery: added 'total_keys' statistics that shows how much keys should be recovered/processed

- tests: created config struct for create_nodes method and moved all argument to it
- pytests: added test case for checking correct handling situation when 2 backends from different nodes has equal group and ids
- pytests: made server node isolated - now server nodes do not know about each other
- core: reset state if dnet_idc_update_backend has been failed.

* Thu Oct 23 2014 Evgeniy Polyakov <zbr@ioremap.net> - 2.26.3.31
